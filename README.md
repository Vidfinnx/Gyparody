Gyparody Quiz Game

I had to make this Quiz Game for my coding class

it was difficult and it is still not even completely

finished in the way that i would like. I have sunk at least

30+ Hours into this minimum. As in Literally Wake up 

and sit on the computer all the way up into the wee hours of the morning.

By all means please enjoy this mock up game. Time is money

in this game!

*Fun fact Gyparody is actually the name of the real custom Jeopardy
font for the logo!

*The real font also from the gameshow category text was also used
called Haettenschweiler
